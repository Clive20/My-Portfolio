# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with React, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience. The site includes:

A clean, responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
A dynamic Projects section featuring the technologies used and project descriptions.
An About Me section highlighting my journey and background.
Styled using modern CSS frameworks and practices, with emphasis on accessibility and performance.
This portfolio serves as a central hub to share my work and connect with potential employers or collaborators.
